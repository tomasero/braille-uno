#BRAILLE-UNO

I found this website http://hitherejoe.com/brailleuno/ and started playing around with the code. This was originally made for solenoid so I had to change it a little bit to use LEDs. It can also work with any vibration motor.

The original code had quite a few errors that I had to fix so it works correctly. Also, I recommend running it at a baud rate of 4800 so chars aren't lost in transmission. Enjoy!
